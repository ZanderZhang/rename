#Rename

A simple ruby script to sync your iOS resources/directories with project name. For now, the script does not rename project name with whitespaces.

`**NOTE: It's probably a good idea to backup your project first.**`

#### How to rename your ios xcode project

1. Tap lightly on the project name (ie. example) to change the name. (see gif above.)

2. A dialog box will appear. Click "Rename" will only rename the .xcodeproj and related resources.

4. Run ./rename and follow the instructions.


#### How to run the script?

1. drop the rename script at the same level as your .xcodeproj file.
2. run the following:
``` ruby
update install
./rename
```

#### What it does?

- It detects the name of _.xcodeproj and compare with its resources name.
- It then changes the name of directories and its resources by searching and replacing the old names.


#### You should place the script under the same level as your .xcodeproj file. See below:
